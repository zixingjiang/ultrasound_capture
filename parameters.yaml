# video capture settings
video_capture:

  # [source] specifies the source of the captured video. 
  # It can be a digit representing the video device or a string representing the path of the video file.
  # Examples:
  # source: 0 (if you are using a laptop, this could be your built-in webcam)
  # source: recordings/video.mp4
  # Remarks for Linux user: for video device such as /dev/video0, just fill 0 here.
  source: 0

  # [width] and [height] specify the frame resolution for the captured video.
  # The higher their values, the higher the performance requirements for the video capture device.
  # High resolution may reduce the capture frame rate.
  width: 1600
  height: 1200


# video recording settings
video_recording:

  # [directory] â€‹specify the directory where recorded video files are stored.
  # It must be a legal directory name for your operating system.
  directory: recordings
  
  # [fps] specify the frame rate of recorded videos.
  # The higher its value, the higher the performance requirements for the video capture device.
  fps: 60


# UDP communication settings
udp_communication:

  # [sender_ip] and [sender_port] specify the socket address of the sender (the capture script).
  # We use IPV4 here. The port should not be occupied by other programs.
  sender_ip: 127.0.0.1
  sender_port: 60511

  # [receiver_ip] and [receiver_port] specify the socket address of the receiver (other programs).
  # We use IPV4 here. The port should not be occupied by other programs.
  receiver_ip: 127.0.0.1
  receiver_port: 60522
  
  # [format] specifies the string format when packing the udp packet
  # See the Python documentation for more details
  # https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#format-strings
  # The receiver should use the same format to unpack the packet
  format: '2d'
